====== Application Frame Manager - AppFM ======

(previously CPM)

AppFM (previously CPM) is a platform that manage applications defined within a frame that we will further refer as [[:spec_draft|modules]].

The initial main purpose of AppFM was to be able to :

  * facilitate the use of already developped applications for testing purpose
  * design applications pipeline
  * provide useful built-in tools and views for common nlp process (POS tagging, dependency parser, corpus statistics, etc.)

In order to achieve these purpose, the AppFM platform is built around :

  * a [[:spec_draft|module implementation guide]]
  * a core server handling the execution and management of module and modules pipeline (both are actually the same kind of object)
  * a command line interface for basic interaction with the core
  * a web interface for advanced viewing of module execution results and creation

===== Background =====

Existing solutions :

  * Enterprise Integration Pattern, Enterprise Service Bus (camel, talend, etc.)
  * NLP Frameworks (UIMA, Gate)
